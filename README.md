Tired of struggling to set up remote collaboration with your team? <a href="http://multihack.co">multihack.co</a>

###Collaborate in Real Time  
Code is synchronized in real time between everyone on your team.  
Work on complex projects with a large number of files.  
All data is sent over an encrypted websockets connection.

###Integrated Voice Chat
Join a secure group call in one click with WebRTC.

###Deploy your Website Instantly  
MultiHack uses <a href="https://github.com/RationalCoding/HyperHost">HyperHost</a> to deploy your web project to the web instantly.  
Test designs with clients without ever needing to setup a server!

###Syntax Highlighting
Syntax highlighting for all web languages is supported.  
MultiHack is built with <a href="https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror">CodeMirror</a>, so adding new highlighting is a breeze!  

###Network With Other Users
MultiHack allows you to see other users online and request to code with them, without any kind of account or URL needed.   
It's great for programming interviews, tutoring, hackathons, or just meeting other developers!
